# MailScream&trade;

_Because, sometimes, it's the only way!!_

### Ever drafted or wanted to send a rage email at 2AM... and had the wisdom not to send it?

Yeah. Us too.

**MailScream&trade;** is your offline scream vault — a local-first CLI app for venting into the void (with sarcasm plugins, if you're brave).

* Compose that spicy email.

* Send it.. Yes, SEND it - into the void.

* Get roasted by your imaginary boss if you enable OpenAI (or OpenAI compatible LLM).

* Repeat as necessary.

**No** servers. **No** surveillance. Just screaming and rolling into the void.

Because burnout is real, and revenge emails are best left unsent.

MailScream&trade; is Not just for catharsis, but for encouraging healthy emotional boundaries! 🎭✨
